# Blackjack-Game

## Description
I created a one-player command-line Blackjack game in which the player interacts with an automated dealer. 
This program takes in user input to place (fake) bets and choose their moves. The moves include to stand, hit, or double down. 
The game follows the traditional rules of the Blackjack card game.
<br><br>To run this program, run the main method in the Game.java file.
